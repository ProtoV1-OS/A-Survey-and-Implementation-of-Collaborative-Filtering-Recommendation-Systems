The <jupyter_notebook> folder consists of the Jupyter Notebooks which contain all the necessary import statements required to execute each file.

Each cell should be executed sequentially to avoid overlapping variable declarations.

The output of each notebook is included in the folder <output> and has been exported as a .html file which is best read in the order:

1) memory_based_filtering (Section 3 of the report)
2) dataset_analysis (Section 4.1)
3) k_nearest_neighbour (Sections 4.1.1 - 4.1.2)
4) matrix_factorisation (Sections 4.2 - 4.2.3)
5) catalogue_coverage (Section 4.2.4)
